# RustDown

Using rust to generate markdown book inspiring by R Markdown. 

The R Markdown is perfect to write book but I just don't like the R environment of it.

And I try to practice Rust by using it in a real project. So here is the project's background.

# System Design

System is based on the design of R Markdown.

# Dependencies

The code is tested on my computer, using Rust 1.52.1, Pandoc 2.14.2 & TeX Live 2021.
